## Equipment

### Flares

- Emergency
  - Rocket flare
    - 300m high
    - Seen 30 miles away in clear visibility
    - Use offshore
    - Send a second flare a minute after the first so other vessels can confirm and find your bearing.
  - Pinpoint flare
    - Visibility 3 miles
    - Hold off side of vessel due to residue
  - Orange smoke
    - Use in daylight
- Non-emergency
  - White warning flare

### EPIRB: Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon

- Activated in Mayday.
- Transmit position info via satellite.
- Reception 70dS to 70dN.
- Must be registered with coastguard.
- Initial alert and position.

### SART

- Device which makes vessel or life raft more conspicious on radar.
- Produces distinctive line of dots/arcs on radar screen.
- Mount as high as possible.
- Signal from life raft detected at ~5 miles (surface vessel) or ~30 miles (aircraft).
- Homing in device.

### Life jackets

- Rated 150N+
- With or without harness.
- Manual (always) and automatic inflation.
  - Manual (pull cord) will not inflate if user unconscious.
  - Automatic (paper element) sometimes inflates in high humidity.
  - Hammer automatic inflates with immersed in 10cm of water for 2-3 seconds.
- Maintenance
  - No nicks and wear in the bladder.
  - Activator is showing green.
  - Gas bottle has no corrosion.
    - End is not pierced.
    - Screwed properly into life jacket.
- Come with a whistle, reflective tape and oral inflation tube.
- Harness, light and thigh straps are often provided separately.

### Harness lines

- Rough weather, always at night, skipper's request.
- Only attach to harness points or jackstays (tapes running along side decks).
- Never harness onto the guard rails.
- Never harness onto rigging if vessel might be knocked down (very rough seas).

### Engine checks

- Before starting engine
  - Check oil viscosity, should not be gritty or creamy.
  - Air filter. If blocked, there might be black smoke from exhaust.
  - Belt, which drives alternator to charge batteries and raw water pump.
  - Coolant water.
  - Raw water filter, sea cock should be open before starting engine.
- After starting engine
  - Check water is coming out of exhaust for a minute or two.
  - Ignition light goes out.
  - Prop is clear and gears engage.

### Kill cord

- Attach around your leg.

### Fire

- Mayday situation!
- Fire blanket in galley for fat fires.
- CO2 for live electrical fires and flammable liquids (paraffin, petrol, oil)
  - Do NOT open engine compartment to extinguish, use extinguisher nozzle through access hole.
- Dry powder for live electrical equipment and flammable solids. Not for gas cooker.
- Foam for wood, plastic, liquids. Can damage engine but is usable.

### Gas

- Bottle should be in vented locker, venting out to sea.
- Gas can build up in bilges and be ignited bu spark.
- Bilges should be pumped out daily with manual pump.
- Turn off gas bottle after use.
- In case of gas alarm
  - Turn off gas source
  - Do not use electrical equipment
  - Vent vessel by opening hatches
  - Pump bilges with manual diaphragm pump
  - Alert crew

## Mayday and Rescue

- If VHF has DSC (Digital Selective Calling), dedicated button (press and hold) for mayday calls
  - Designated DSC call for man overboard
  - Undesignated DSC call otherwise
  - MMSI: Maritime mobile service identity allocated to radio/vessel

- Verbal Mayday
  - Only for grave or imminent danger to life or vessel
  - VHF16 full power

- Urgent non life threatening situations
  - PAN-PAN
  - Call Coastguard

- Preparing for helicopter rescue
  - Stow loose gear around pushpit, including buoys
  - Make sure port quarter is clear

  - Use engine
  - Put away sails
  - Hand held flares (night), orange smoke (day)

## Dinghies

- Wear life jackets.
- Check tide and weather.
- Load crew evenly.
- Take oars when using an engine.
- Take a pump for inflatable dinghies.
- Torch at night.
- Maybe take VHF and mini flares.
- Painter should be tied to bow but not long enough to reach propeller.
- Avoid strong currents in rivers.

## Drogues

- Sea anchors.
- Used to stop drifting during engine failure or slow boat down in strong winds.
- Streamed from stern if vessel underway or from bow to hold into weather conditions.

## Preparing for strong weather

- Get crew into warm, waterproof gear.
- Put on lifejackets.
- Clip on harness lines.
- Reef sails.
- Close hatches.
- Check stowage.

- Consider seasickness tablets.

## Fire safety

- No smoking below decks.

- Do not leave the cooker unattended when in use.
- Do not leave items near the cooker that might fall or swing into the flames whilst underway.
- Be familiar with the location and operation of the extinguishers, fire blanket and alarms.
- Be alert to the gauges that show engine overheating and for any smell or smoke that might indicate overheating or sparks.

## Fog

- Avoid setting out in fog if at all possible.
- Establish position.
- Put on lifejackets.
- Put up radar reflector.
- Put on navigation lights.
- Reduce speed and consider switching to engine.
- Use fog sound signals.
- Post extra lookouts.
- Consider diverting to shallow water or anchorage.
- Use GPS, VHF, echo sounder.
- Have dinghy/life raft ready.
- Wake up crew!
- Have a white flare ready.

## Radar reflector

- Ideally a fixed one that's as large as possible and fitted as high as possible.
- Yacht over power rule doesn't apply in low visibility conditions as other vessels can't tell.

## Abandoning to liferaft

- Send mayday and fire flares if possible.
- Instruct crew to wear lifejackets, warm clothing and thermal protective aids.
- Collect grab bag, drinking water and useful equipment if there is time.
- Make sure painter is attached.
- Throw raft to leeward (downwind) and tug on painter to inflate.
- Step across or up to life raft from sinking vessel.
- Put heaviest, strongest crew in first to stabilise and assist others.

- Once aboard the liferaft
  - Cut painter
  - Paddle away
  - Stream drogue to reduce leeway
  - Setup radar reflector
  - Bail out excess water
  - Pump up raft floor
  - Take seasickness pills
  - Close the door
  - Ventilate interior every hour
  - Keep lookout
