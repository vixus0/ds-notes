# Nautical terms

## Standing rigging

Fixed ropes and supports for holding things in place.

- Mast held by shrouds, forestay and backstay.
- Mast deck- or keel-stepped (attached).

- Cross trees/spreaders keep shrouds apart as they go up to attach to mast.
- Cap shrouds attach at the top of the mast.
- Intermediate shrouds attach 2/3 up the mast.

- Stem is the physical front edge of the boat.
- Stem head fitting is the metal bit at the front.
- Stem head fitting often has bow roller for anchor chain to run in/out.
- Forestay is sometimes attached to stem head fitting.
- Fractional rig is when the forestay attaches below the top of the mast.

## Sails

- Luff, leech and foot are leading, trailing and bottom edges of sail.

- Tack is the leading corner of a sail.
- Clew is the trailing corner of a sail.

- Reefing is decreasing the sail area through furling or tying down.

- Battens (flexible inserts) in the pockets of a sail give it rigidity.
  - Fully battened main
  - Part battened main
  - No battens
  - Vertical battens that roll up with the sail

### Foresail

- Furling foresail
  - Foresail sheet for unfurling headsail/foresail.
  - Foresail furling line for furling headsail/foresail.
  - Pro: easy to use
  - Con: loses shape when size is reduced

### Mainsail

- Headboard is reinforced area at the top of the mainsail.

- Halyard rope
  - Runs along the mast.
  - Attached to the headboard and holds the weight of the mainsail.

- Reefing
  - Reefing pennants are ropes used to fix areas of the sail.
  - Reefing cringles are holes that the pennants go through.
  - Mainsail can also furl into the mast or be dropped into a bag at the boom.

## Running rigging

Ropes used to hold and control moving parts.

### Boom

- Topping lift
  - Runs from aft end of boom to top of mast.
  - Changes angle of the boom to the mast.
  - Used to secure boom when reducing sail area.

- Kicker/Vang supports the boom.

- Main sheet controls angle of boom (and therefore mainsail) to the wind.

- Gooseneck is the hinge attaching the boom to the mast.

- Tack is the mast end of the boom.
- Clew is the aft/stern end of the boom.

## Topside of vessel

- Port is the left side.
- Starboard is the right side.
- Bow is the front (and front corners).
- Stern is the very back.
- Quarter is the back corners.
- Amidships is the middle section.

- Some of these can be combined, e.g. port bow or starboard quarter.

- Cockpit is where the boat is operated from.
  - Helm or tiller for steering.
  - Winches for hardening or easing sails.
  - Furling lines and sheets.
  - Halyards for hoisting sails.

- Companion way is the entrance to the inside.

- Cleats are a fitting which ropes can be tied to.

- Windlass is a winch used to lift/weigh the anchor or haul in a rope.
  Usually found on the foredeck.

- Windward side is the upwind side of the boat (being hit by the wind).
- Leeward is the opposite side.

- Motion is forwards and astern instead of forwards and backwards.

- People moving on the boat go forward and go aft.
