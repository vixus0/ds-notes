# Electronic aids

## Radar

- HL: Heading line
- RR: Range rings
- EBL: Electronic bearing line (controllable)
- VRM: Variable range marker (controllable)
- FTC: Fast time constant (to remove rain/hail echoes)
- Clutter: Remove small features from swell or breaking waves

- If a vessel stays on the EBL and distance is decreasing there is risk of collision.

- Beam width of radar may increase size of small targets (beam is wider farther out).
  - Gaps such as harbour entrances can appear smaller.
  - Only show when close enough for radar beam to pass through entrance.

- Radar beacon (racon)
  - On receiving a radar pulse, they respond with a signal on the same frequency.
  - Signal makes an image on radar display (dots and dashes).
