## Instruments

- Depth sounder
  - Affected by:
    - Soft mud
    - Going astern due to propeller wash
    - Large fish, shoals of fish
    - Bubbles from another vessel's wake
    - Different temperature layers in the water
    - Suspended sediment
  - Ineffective for depths over 100m.
  - Can set to read:
    - from bottom of keel
      :) when reading is zero boat will ground
      :( draught of vessel has to be added to get actual depth
    - from transducer
      :) no artificial error
      :( need to calculate clearance under keel and depth of water
    - actual depth
      :) shows depth of water
      :( need to take draught of vessel into account for sufficient depth
  - Can alarm for minimum maximum depth.
  - Can sound when specific depth reached.

- Log: records speed and distance through water
