# Which tack

- Tack is which side of the vessel wind is on.
- Determined by boom/mainsail.
- Example: boom carried on starboard, wind coming from port = port tack

- Collision avoidance
  - PORT tack gives way to STARBOARD tack
  - Assume vessel is on starboard tack unless you are certain it's not.
  - Power-driven vessels (including yachts under engine) give way to sail.

- Running downwind
  - Better to run downwind on starboard tack.
  - Advantage in close quarters situation, you are the stand-on vessel.
  - Take care to avoid change of wind direction or yacht direction.
  - Accidental gybe when boom swings across the cockpit.

- Points of sail (clockwise)
  - In irons: into wind
  - Close hauled
  - Close reach
  - Beam reach: perpendicular to wind
  - Broad reach
  - Run
