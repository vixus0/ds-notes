# Chartwork and position fixing

## Compass variation and deviation

T = True
M = Magnetic
C = Compass

var = variation: difference between T and M
dev = deviation: caused by ferrous objects on boat

M = T + var(W) - var(E)
C = T + var(W) + dev(W) - var(E) - dev(E)

- To plot M bearing on chart, need to convert to T bearing.
- Compass rose will give true north, magnetic bearing at some year and yearly change (minutes).

## Compass types

- Ships compass/steering compass
  - Fixed position
  - Can be corrected for deviation with a deviation card

- Hand bearing compass
  - Used to take bearings of objects
  - Collision avoidance
  - Susceptible to deviation which can't be quantified

- Fluxgate compass
  - EM device
  - Digitised readings
  - Corrected electronically for deviation
