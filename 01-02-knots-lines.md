# Knots and lines

## Knots

- Bowline
  - Good for trying to bollards.
  - Difficult to undo under tension.
  - Used for tying sheets to jib or genoa.
  - Used for forming a loop in the end of a rope.

- Reef
  - Used for joining two ropes.
  - Can slip under pressure.
  - Used for tying down the bunt (unused part of reefed sail).

- Round turn + two half hitches
  - Good for tying to posts or ring bollards.
  - Can be undone under tension.
  - Used for securing a tow.

- Rolling hitch
  - Good for tying to posts.
  - Resists movement along post in a single direction.
  - Used to undo lines under tension.
    - Rolling hitch is put around the line and standing part taken to a winch to reduce tension.
  - Used to snub the anchor
    - Take the tension off the anchor chain by putting a rolling hitch around it and tying the
      attached warp (standing end of rope) to a cleat on deck.

- Clove hitch
  - Used for tying on fenders to guardrail (additional half hitch recommended).
  - Used for attaching a tow.

- Sheet bend
  - Used for joining ropes of different thickness.

- Double sheet bend

## Rope materials

- Kevlar
  - Good for halyards, etc.

- Polyester
  - Similar to kevlar but not as good.

- Polypropylene
  - Floats

- Nylon
  - Very strong
  - Stretches
  - Sinks so it will lie along the seabed and reduce the risk of wrapping around the prop
