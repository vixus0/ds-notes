# Tides

## Tidal Heights

- Spring tide: highest and lowest tides
- Neaps tide: less high and low tides
- Mean: average height over 19 years
- M{H,L}W{S,N}: Mean {High,Low} Water {Springs,Neaps}
- Range: Difference between HW/LW for the sailing period
- HAT: Highest astronomical tide
  - Vertical clearances usually given above this
- LAT: Lowest astronomical tide
- Chart datum (0.0m depth): often the same as LAT
- Drying area: area that covers/uncovers with rise/fall of tide
- Drying height: height of drying area above chart datum
- Height of tide: Chard datum to sea level
- Depth of water: Measured depth to sea level
- Rise of tide: LW to sea level when tide is rising
- Fall of tide: HW to sea level when tide is falling
- Charted height: height measured above MHWS (lighthouses, spot heights, etc.)

## Depth sounder

- Works up to 100m
- Before taking vessel out do a manual depth check with line and weight.
- Check if sounder is reading from bottom of keel, hull, or sea level.

## Tidal curves

- Use to get height of tide between HW/LW
- Anchoring
  - Minimum depth to anchor = Fall of tide (next LW) + Vessel draught + Extra clearance
  - Anchor chain to lay = (Rise of tide (next HW) + Minimum anchoring depth) * 4
- Transit
  - Height of tide to transit = Minimum depth - Vessel draught - Clearance
