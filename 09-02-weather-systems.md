# Metereology

## Weather systems

- Sea state
  - Close to inshore in offshore blowing wind = calmer sea
  - Close to shore in onshore blowing wind (lee shore) = rougher sea due to shallower depth
  - Wind in the same direction as tide (e.g. north wind + south tide) = calmer sea
  - Longer fetch (distance wind travels over sea) builds up wave height
  - Wind in the opposite direction to tide (even moderate) = very serious seas (wind over tide)
  - Avoid staying inshore round headlands in wind over tide situation.

- Bands of high and low pressure between equator and poles.
- Weather systems develop where air masses meet.
- When bands of cold and warm air meet, depressions develop.

## High pressure system

- Wind moves clockwise and slightly outward in the northern hemisphere around a high pressure system.
- Wind moves anticlockwise in the southern hemisphere around a high pressure system.
- Light winds and settled weather.
- Usually clear skies but downward airflow can bring haze and pollution.
- When squeezed against a low pressure system can create strong conditions in squeeze zone.

## Low pressure system

- Storms ahoy.
- Occurs when band of warm air pushes into band of cold air.
- Wind moves anticlockwise and slightly inwards in northern hemisphere.
- Movement of whole system is usually similar to direction of winds in warm sector and parallel
  with isobars.
- If depression passes to the north of you, winds at your location undergo clockwise rotation,
  known as VEERING.
- If depression passes to the south, winds change anticlockwise, known as BACKING.
- Veering = any clockwise wind direction change
- Backing = any anticlockwise wind direction change

## Behaviour of a depression

**Buys Ballot's Law: Back to the blow, left to the low**

- As warm front approaches
  - wind will be backing and increase in intensity.
  - barometric pressure will fall.
  - high wispy cloud getting progressively thicker and lower.
  - rain will begin.
- At the warm front
  - heavy rain and low visibility.
  - wind veers as we pass over the front.
- In warm sector
  - air is more moist so low cloud, fine drizzle/fog
  - depression moving parallel to isobars, so barometer and wind will become steady
- At cold front
  - dark/turbulent clouds with heavy rain underneath
  - thunder and lightning of cold front squall
  - sudden veering wind as cold front passes, causing choppy seas
- After the cold front
  - crossing isobars away from depression centre, increasing barometric pressure
  - clear weather for 1-2 hours followed by isolated/scattered showers

Warm Front    Approaching           Passing             Passed (in warm sector)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wind          increases/backs       veers               steady
cloud         thickens/lowers       thick/low/dark      low
rain          becomes heavier       decreases           drizzle
vis           deteriorates          deteriorates        moderate/fog likely
pressure      falling               stops falling       steady

Cold Front    Approaching           Passing             Passed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wind          steady                sudden veer/squall  steady
cloud         stratus               cumulonimbus        clear/isolated cumulus
rain          heavy near front      heavy with thunder  fine for a spell
vis           moderate/foggy        poor in rain        very good
pressure      steady                sudden rise         rises then stabilises

## Interacting systems

- H+H: Winds oppose, light and variable wind
- H+L: Winds add, very strong and directional between the systems
- L+L: Winds oppose, lighter winds between but stronger between cold front and warm front
- 2H+2L (like a battenburg): light winds in centre, best escape through a high
