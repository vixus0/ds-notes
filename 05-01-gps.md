### Terms

- HDOP: Horizontal dilution of precision

- XTE: Cross track error
  How much the vessel is off course from proposed ground track.

- SOG: Speed over ground
  Actual speed of the vessel over the ground (not relative to tide or leeway).

- COG: Course over ground
  As above but position.

- TTG: Time to go
  How long to reach the waypoint.

- VMG: Velocity made good
  Actual speed towards destination even if vessel is tacking or not taking a straight line.

- DTW: Distance to waypoint.

- BTW: Bearing to waypoint.

### Position fixing

- Navigation web
  - Use the BTW/DTW to quickly fix position.

- Passage planning
  - Set a XTE alarm when tacking up a channel between hazards.
  - DO NOT use for close quarters piloting.

- Rolling road
  - Use reciprocal of BTW and DTW to fix position.

### Sources of error

- Power failure
- Damage to aerial
- Mobile phones
- Faulty or poor signal
- Fewer than 4 satellites
- HDOP >2 (1.4 is the best)
