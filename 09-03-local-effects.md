- Sea breeze: warm air off land cools over the sea, creating an onshore breeze.
- Night breeze: sea cools more slowly, so there is an offshore breeze.
  - Can cause fog blowl offshore in the early morning.
- Radiation fog: usually forms over land, worst in winter
- Advection fog: sea fog caused by warm moist air passing over a cold sea.
  - common in spring and summer
  - can persist several days
  - unaffected by winds up to 15kn
