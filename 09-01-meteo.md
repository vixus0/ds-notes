  - Moderate: 2-5mi
  - Poor: 1100yd-2mi
  - Fog: <1100yd
  - Mist/haze: 1100-2200yd

- Sea state (wave height)
  - Smooth: 0.2-0.5m
  - Slight: 0.5-1.25m
  - Moderate: 1.25-2.5m
  - Rough: 2.5-4m
  - Very rough: 4-6m

- Terms
  - Fair: no significant rain/snow
  - Backing wind: wind changing direction CCW, e.g. NW to SW
  - Veering wind: wind changing direction CW, e.g. NE to SE

- Wind against tide may make sea state worse at different times of day when dir. of tide changes.
- Sea state != swell, little swell and rough sea state can be exciting sailing.
  Rough sea with 4m swell and breaking waves can be dangerous.
