# Chartwork and position fixing

## Logbook

- Time
- Distance
- Depth
- Bearing
- Speed

## Three point fix

- Take bearings to three objects
  - Take object nearest stern first, as it'll change the least over time
  - Note time, boat speed, and steering course in logbook
- Convert bearings to T
- Plot bearings from objects, to see where they (roughly) cross
- Triangle of potential fix (cocked hat)
  - If no dangers nearby, use centre as fix
  - Otherwise, choose point closest to the danger as fix (worst case scenario)


## Dead reckoning and estimated position

- Given start position at some time, the course to steer (CTS) and boat speed can be used to
  give DR position in 1 hour's time.
- Convert to estimated position (EP) by adding tidal drift vector (rate of tide over 1 hour).
- There is always some error due to sideways drift due to wind (leeway).
  - Circle of error (when navigating in fog)
- Always use visual fix to confirm EP.
- Depth can also be used to confirm EP, if height of tide is accounted for.
- Can use a projected EP to predict where the boat will be in some time and to check
  crossing is safe.

- COG: Course over ground (bearing)
- SOG: Speed over ground (knots)
