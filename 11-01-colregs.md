# Collision regulations (COLREGs)

## Right of way

- There is *no* right of way, all skippers are responsible.
- Decide if you are give way or stand on vessel.
- As give way vessel, make a significant and clear alteration of course.
- As stand on vessel, continue on present course and speed until unsafe.
- Local rules always take priority.

## Vessel priority (descending)

- Not under command / restricted in ability to manoeuvre.
- Constrained by draught.
- Fishing / trawling / dredging / minesweeping.
- Sail
- Power

## Keep watch

- Radar, sight, sound.
- Listen for sound signals.
- Listen for engine noise.
- Look behind sails.
- Reduce size of headsail in busy areas.
- Listen on VHF for shipping.
- Take repeated bearings of approaching vessel.

## Narrow channels

- Small craft should not impede shipping traffic.
- Keep to starboard side.
- Avoid anchoring in channel.

## Traffic separation schemes (TSS)

- Join at shallow angle.
- Vessels crossing TSS must give way.
- Cross with vessel aspect at right angle to TSS.
