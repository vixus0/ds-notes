# Buoyage & Pilotage

## Pilotage

- Clearing bearings
  - Based on some significant object.
  - Two bearings: NOT LESS THAN/NOT MORE THAN to create cone that clears obstacles.

- Pilot plan
  - Course steered, distance run and minimum depth for each leg.
  - In a buoyed channel, look for next buoy on EXPECTED bearing from pilot plan.
  - Never continue if plan isn't working or if you're unsure of vessel position.

- Navigation in fog
  - First thing when you see fog, take a fix or go to a nearby buoy and locate it on the chart.
  - Establish position of vessel.
  - Ensure all crew have life jackets.
  - Check radar reflector.
  - Find and follow known contour, accounting for height of tide.
  - Use a circle of error when navigating.
  - Use sound signals.
  - Stop and listen.
  - Keep out of shipping lanes.
  - Consider anchoring in shallow water and waiting it out.
  - All crew on deck.
  - Everyone should look out for vessels and dangers.
  - Don't aim for the destination, aim to one side so that in case of wind or tide so you 
    know which way to turn.
