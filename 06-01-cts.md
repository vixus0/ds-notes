# Course to steer

## Plotting a CTS

### Info required up front

- Start point
- Destination
- Estimated speed and time of travel
- Date and start time for tides
- Magnetic variation
- Wind speed and bearing for leeway

### Process

- Draw ground track from start position to destination (two arrows on line)
  - extend through destination
- Get approximate time to destination based on (estimated) vessel speed and distance
  - Nearest half hour to calculate tidal drift
- Draw the tidal vector line (three arrows on line) from start point
  - Length is tidal speed * travel time
  - Tidal vectors can be stacked per hour
- Draw water track from end of tidal vector to point on ground track (one arrow on line)
  - Length is vessel speed * travel time
- Where the water track crosses the ground track is the intercept
  - Where the boat will end up in the given travel time
- Bearing of water track gives you course to steer (CTS) (True)
- To counteract leeway, boat will need to steer towards the wind by the amount of expected leeway
- Correct for variation to get (M) bearing and deviation to get (C) bearing 
- Speed over ground (SOG) = distance from start to intercept / travel time
- Time to go (TTG) in minutes = distance to destination / SOG * 60

## Check course over ground (COG) is being maintained

- Put destination waypoint into GPS and check XTE
- Use hand bearing compass to maintain back bearing to last waypoint
  - should be reciprocal of ground track
- Take forward fixes to next waypoint
  - should be the same as proposed ground track
- Use depth and contours
- Take fixes to check position
