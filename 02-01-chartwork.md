# Chartwork

## Terminology

- Chart datum (CD): relative value of zero depth, usually lowest astronomical depth
- Drying area: area of land exposed by tidal changes

## Points of compass

- North at 000d
- East at 090d
- West at 270d
- South at 180d
- SSE, ESE, NNW, etc.

- Bearings are relative to True North (T) and should always be written in 3 figures: 001d(T)

## Latitude and longitude

- Latitude scale is on left and right hand sides of map.
  - 00 deg at equator.
  - 90 deg at poles.
  - Used for measuring distance.
  - Each degree of latitude = 60 nautical miles (nm)
  - Each minute of latitude = 1nm
  - *Note* scale varies as you move away from the equator so pick latitude close to your chartwork.
  - Written as degress, minutes and decimals of minutes: 00d00'.00 N (or S)
                                             also valid: 00d00.00' N

- Longitude scale is on top and bottom.
  - Only used for position.
  - Never use to measure speed or distance.
  - Measured E or W of Greenwich (00d) up to international date line (180d).
  - Written with three figure degrees: 000d00.00' W (or E)
