# Anchoring

## Choosing an anchorage

- Check the chart
  - Not a restricted area
  - Not infringing local port authority rules
  - Area is free from obstructions/rocks/anything that could snag the anchor
  - Seabed is suitable for anchoring
- Check the weather
  - DO NOT anchor near lee shore (wind blowing onto shore)
  - If anchor drags, vessel could end up being grounded
  - Waves get higher closer to shore which could capsize vessel
- Check area is reasonably sheltered
- Check tide and current
- Check you're clear of traffic
- Make sure there is enough room if the vessel swings around the anchor

Quiz:

    Sheltered from the present and forecast winds.

    Out of a channel used by ships and other boats.

    Sufficient depth at low water, but not too deep to cause the
    anchor to drag at high water.

    Room to swing when the tide turns, remembering that different shaped boats will lie
    differently to the wind and tide.

    Good holding ground i.e. mud or sand.

    Out of a strong tidal stream or swell.

    Not inside an 'Anchoring Prohibited' area.

## Securing the anchor

- Gently reverse the vessel to check
  - If the chain trembles, anchor is dragging
  - Bow dip indicates anchor digging in
- Look for fixed objects off the beam
- Use anchor ball by day and anchor light at night
- Set an anchor alarm on the GPS or chart plotter
- Monitor echo sounder for depth changes
- Set maximum minimum alarm on echo sounder (taking tide into consideration).

## Tides

- Allow for high tides and low tides when paying out anchor chain.
- Need to make sure that as tide rises, anchor doesn't hang on the end of the chain.
- Need to make sure vessel doesn't ground as tide drops.

- Anchoring with chain only
  - Pay out 4x maximum depth of water (at high tide)

- Anchoring with chain and warp
  - Pay out 6x maximum depth

- Anchoring in strong two-way tidal flow (where flow can reverse)
  - One anchor upstream and one anchor downstream (boat parallel to flow)
  - Make sure lengths on both chains are even
  - Make sure both anchors have enough chain laid out to hold the boat

- Anchoring in strong one-way tidal flow (like a river)
  - Place two anchors upstream

## Types of anchor

- Parts of anchor
  - Shank (shaft bit)
  - Crown (end of shank)
  - Fluke (spade bit that digs in)
  - Stock (perpendicular stick thing)

- Danforth
  - Stows flat in a locker
  - Used mostly as a spare anchor
  - Good in mud and sand
  - Poor in gravel and rock
  - Tripping line can be attached to tripping eye at the crown to pull a stuck anchor

- Delta
  - Good all-rounder and very good holding capabilities.
  - Stows and self launches off bow roller
  - No moving parts
  - Tripping line can be attached to crown if there's a risk of stuck anchor

- Grapnel
  - Used for small boats
  - Folds well and stows away
  - Average performance but good for rocks

- Bruce
  - Similar to delta.
  - Good holding.
  - Good for mud and sand.

- Fisherman's
  - Good for rock and kelp.
  - Bad for mud and sand.
  - Stows flat but gets easily tangled.

- CQR / Plough
  - Very good in mud or sand
  - Penetrates grass and weeds
  - Tripping line

- Mushroom
  - For small boats
  - Good in mud or sand
  - Not good for grass and weeds
